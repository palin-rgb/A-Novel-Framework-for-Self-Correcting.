# A-Novel-Framework-for-Self-Correcting.
 This repository contains the prototype for a "Crisis-Driven Learning" artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning, this agent does not require rewards. Instead, it learns by treating high prediction errors as logical "crises," which trigger non-monotonic belief revision to build a coherent and interpretable world model.
